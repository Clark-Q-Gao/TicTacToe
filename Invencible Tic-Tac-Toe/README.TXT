Hi!

In the process of learning java, I made an "Invencible Tic-Tac-Toe", being this version a remake. It's free to play and the source code is available on my website.

Go check saclyr.net for many more games, and donate to support the website and my cause.

I hope you like it, and have a nice game :D
